# WYWM-Introduction-Web-Development
## Task

Design and development are two core skills for all software developers and HTML, CSS and JavaScript are core web development languages. In your assignment, you’ll combine basic design tasks as well as beginner coding skills to create your webpage. 

Start by selecting an API (Application Programming Interface) to use in your project.

Choose a few endpoints to use on your web page. You’re free to be as creative with the functionality as you like, but at a minimum, your web page must have at least three features. 

One feature equals:
- Require user or programmatic input
- Interact with your chosen API
- Display the result of the interaction to the user

Once you’ve decided what you want your web page to do, you’ll need to create a basic design for functionality and layout. You’ll need to create two project artefacts per feature:
- Functionality: Create a diagram showing the interactions between the user, the web page and the API for each feature.
- User interface: Create a wireframe diagram for how you want to layout the user interface of your web page.

## Weather API
I used the https://www.weatherapi.com/ "Weather API" API to create a webpage that displays the weather for a city that the user can search for using the search box.
